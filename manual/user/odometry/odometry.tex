\chapter{Odometry Module}
\label{cha:vodom}
Visual odometry is the process of determining the position and
orientation (the pose) of a camera relative to a given target by
analyzing a sequence of images. Contrarily to object tracking in
image coordinates, visual odometry needs calibrated cameras. It 
implies the knowledge of camera intrinsic parameters. Consequently, 
the \lstinline$Rox_Camera$ object shall be fed with the correct 
camera  intrinsic parameters. Incorrect camera intrinsic parameters
will produce an incorrect localization.

The localization of the camera in the environment can be useful in several applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and many others.\\

The Odometry module contains the following sub-modules:

\begin{description}
% \item[Odometry Parameters]~: module with structures and methods for handling the tracking parameters
  \item[Odometry Single Plane]~: module with structures and methods for camera localization relative to a single plane
  \item[Odometry Multi Planes]~: module with structures and methods for camera localization relative to a multi planes
  \item[Odometry Inertial Observer]~: module with structures and methods for camera localization with inertial observer
\end{description}
